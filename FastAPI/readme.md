## 📘 **FASTAPI MASTER ROADMAP (1 to 25) — With MongoDB**

| # | Topic | Summary |
|--|-------|---------|
| **1** | ✅ FastAPI Basics | Setup, routing, HTTP methods, status codes, Pydantic |
| **2** | 🧠 Dependency Injection | Use `Depends()` to inject logic cleanly (services, DB, auth) |
| **3** | 🗂️ Project Structure | Feature-based modular layout — scalable & microservices-ready |
| **4** | 🍃 MongoDB Integration | Use `motor` (async) with `pydantic` models & DB service layer |
| **5** | 🔐 JWT Auth | Register, login, hash passwords, issue/verify JWT tokens |
| **6** | 🔁 Refresh Tokens | Add secure long-lived refresh tokens (stored in DB or cookies) |
| **7** | 📄 Pagination | Offset & cursor-based pagination with metadata in response |
| **8** | 📂 File Uploads | Upload single/multiple files & images (validate + store) |
| **9** | 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Protect routes via roles: admin, user, moderator |
| **10** | 🚀 Caching | Use Redis to cache views, filters, and slow DB queries |
| **11** | 🛒 Cart + Wishlist | Add, update, remove items; persist in Redis/Mongo |
| **12** | 💳 Orders + Checkout | Place order, track status, handle pricing, stock lock |
| **13** | 📦 Inventory System | Real-time stock sync, mutex during checkout, low-stock alert |
| **14** | 🧾 Invoice PDF + Emails | Generate invoice PDFs and send via email in background |
| **15** | 🔍 Product Search | Use Mongo `$text` or integrate with Elasticsearch |
| **16** | ⭐ Ratings + Reviews | One review per user/product, avg rating, spam protection |
| **17** | 📊 Analytics Dashboard | Use aggregations for top sales, revenue, and KPIs |
| **18** | ✉️ Email Notifications | Async email (SMTP, SendGrid), e.g. order confirmed, reset |
| **19** | ⏱️ Background Tasks | Use `BackgroundTasks`, Celery, or APScheduler for async/scheduled jobs |
| **20** | 🖼️ Image Optimization | Resize/compress product images (Pillow + Cloudinary/MinIO) |
| **21** | 🗑️ Soft Delete + Audit Logs | `is_deleted` + track user activity and admin changes |
| **22** | 🏬 Multi-Vendor/Tenant | Allow different vendors to manage own products/orders |
| **23** | 🌐 i18n + Currency | Localize text, convert currencies via APIs |
| **24** | 🧪 Testing Suite | Unit + integration tests using Pytest, TestClient, Docker test DB |
| **25** | 🚢 Deployment & Scaling | Use Uvicorn, Docker, Nginx, Mongo cluster, monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) |
